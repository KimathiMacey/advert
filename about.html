            <h1>About Halloween</h1>
            <p>
                Halloween’s origins date back to the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain (pronounced sow-in). 
                The Celts, who lived 2,000 years ago, mostly in the area that is now Ireland, the United 
                Kingdom and northern France, celebrated their new year on November 1.This day marked the end of 
                summer and the harvest and the beginning of the dark, cold winter,a time of year that was often 
                associated with human death. Celts believed that on the night before the new year, the boundary 
                between the worlds of the living and the dead became blurred. On the night of October 31 they 
                celebrated Samhain, when it was believed that the ghosts of the dead returned to earth.
                <br>
                In addition to causing trouble and damaging crops, Celts thought that the presence of the 
                otherworldly spirits made it easier for the Druids, or Celtic priests, to make predictions about 
                the future. For a people entirely dependent on the volatile natural world, these prophecies were 
                an important source of comfort during the long, dark winter.To commemorate the event, Druids built 
                huge sacred bonfires, where the people gathered to burn crops and animals as sacrifices to the Celtic 
                deities. During the celebration, the Celts wore costumes, typically consisting of animal heads and skins,
                and attempted to tell each other’s fortunes. When the celebration was over, they re-lit their hearth
                fires, which they had extinguished earlier that evening, from the sacred bonfire to help protect them 
                during the coming winter.

            <h1>Halloween Parties</h1>
             <p>By the 1920s and 1930s, Halloween had become a secular but community-centered holiday, 
                with parades and town-wide Halloween parties as the featured entertainment. Despite the 
                best efforts of many schools and communities, vandalism began to plague some celebrations
                in many communities during this time.
                <br>
                By the 1950s, town leaders had successfully limited vandalism and Halloween had evolved 
                into a holiday directed mainly at the young. Due to the high numbers of young children during 
                the fifties baby boom, parties moved from town civic centers into the classroom or home, where 
                they could be more easily accommodated.
                
                <br>
                Between 1920 and 1950, the centuries-old practice of trick-or-treating was also revived.
                 Trick-or-treating was a relatively inexpensive way for an entire community to share the Halloween 
                 celebration. In theory, families could also prevent tricks being played on them by providing the 
                 neighborhood children with small treats.Thus, a new American tradition was born, and it has continued 
                 to grow. Today, Americans spend an estimated $6 billion annually on Halloween, making it the country’s
                  second largest commercial holiday after Christmas.

             <<h1>History of Trick-or-Treating</h1>
             <p>Borrowing from European traditions, Americans began to dress up in costumes and go house to
                 house asking for food or money, a practice that eventually became today’s “trick-or-treat” 
                 tradition. Young women believed that on Halloween they could divine the name or appearance 
                 of their future husband by doing tricks with yarn, apple parings or mirrors.
                <br>
                In the late 1800s, there was a move in America to mold Halloween into a holiday more about 
                community and neighborly get-togethers than about ghosts, pranks and witchcraft. At the turn 
                of the century, Halloween parties for both children and adults became the most common way to 
                celebrate the day. Parties focused on games, foods of the season and festive costumes.
                
                <br>
                Parents were encouraged by newspapers and community leaders to take anything “frightening” 
                or “grotesque” out of Halloween celebrations. Because of these efforts, Halloween lost most of 
                its superstitious and religious overtones by the beginning of the twentieth century.
